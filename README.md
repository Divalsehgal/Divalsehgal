Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dival Sehgal, and this is my GitHub journey!
About Me
I'm just a regular person with a passion for turning coffee into code and solving real-world problems with tech. Over the past year, I've been on this wild adventure called full stack development. It's been a rollercoaster of bugs, "aha" moments, and lots of late-night coding sessions.

Skills: JavaScript (React is my jam), HTML, CSS (I try to make things look pretty), Python (Django), MongoDB (I talk to databases a lot), Git (because version control is cool)
Experience: Survived 365 days in the coding jungle
Education: Self-taught coder with a side of online courses

My Tech Playground
I play with various tech toys, and sometimes they even work:

Frontend Fun: React, Angular (I'm learning, okay?)
Backend Banter: Node.js, Express, Django (because Python is awesome)
Database Dalliance: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
Version Control Voodoo: Git, GitHub (still afraid of merge conflicts)
Keeping it Real
I've stumbled upon my fair share of bugs, had moments of imposter syndrome, and Googled more error messages than I care to admit. But that's the beauty of coding, right? Embracing the struggle and celebrating the small victories.

Open Source Love
I've dipped my toes into the open source pool. Check out my humble contributions â€“ every line of code counts, right?

Random Musings
I occasionally spill my thoughts and tech musings on my blog. It's a mix of genuine experiences, coding frustrations, and the occasional "why is this not working" rant.

Let's Grab Coffee
I'm always up for a good tech chat, collaboration, or just to share coding war stories. Shoot me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn. Let's make the coding community a bit smaller and cozier!

Here's to another year of coding adventures! ðŸš€
